This is a porting to Kotlin of the original kata by [@xpmatteo](https://github.com/xpmatteo).
You can find the original readme at [here](originalRDME.md).

The **goal** of this version is to do a complete migration from `Java` to `Kotlin`.
The kata itself is not really complex so what I'm going to try is to refactor it, add several spring-boot features and then migrate it completely.

Usually this is a common use case in companies where you start with microservices in Java.

Welcome to `kata` branch!

####Iteration \#1
I used this [link] to migrate from a `java` project to a mixed project `kotlin`/`java`.

The main point is that `kotlin` code should compile before `java` code so that it can be used.

Test is still failing so everything is being executed

####Iteration \#2
Started refactoring in `Java`. Almost addressed all the peculiar points.
